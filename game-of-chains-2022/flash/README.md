## Status

* Timeline
  * 2022-12-05: Proposal goes into voting period
  * 2022-12-08: Chain initialized

Flash will launch as a consumer chain through a governance proposal in the `provider` chain. Read the [Consumer Chain Start Process](/docs/Consumer-Chain-Start-Process.md) page for more details about the workflow.  

Flash uses a forked version of the Cosmos SDK `[Flash SDK]`(https://github.com/clemensgg/flash-sdk) with updated default consensus timeout parameters, to allow a **target block production rate of ~1.7s / block**. We'll use this chain to test eventual issues with relayer performance due to diverging block times.

The following items will be included in the proposal:
* Genesis file hash
* The SHA256 is used to verify against the genesis file that the proposer has made available for review.
* This "fresh" genesis file cannot be used to run the chain: it must be updated with the CCV states after the spawn time is reached.
* Binary hash
* Spawn time
* Even if the proposal passes, the CCV states will not be available from the provider chain until after the spawn time is reached.

## Chain Data

### Binary

The binary published in this repo is the `flashd` binary built using the `clemensgg/flash` repo tag [v0.1.0](https://github.com/clemensgg/flash/releases/tag/v0.1.0). You can generate the binary following the [Get Started section](https://github.com/clemensgg/flash/tree/v0.1.0#get-started).  

* [Linux amd64 build](https://github.com/clemensgg/flash/releases/download/v0.1.0/flashd-v0.1.0-linux-amd64)
* Version: `v0.1.0`
* SHA256: `d99c27a84f3d37c3f1bbcfbb1c9187eadb695c77967706805692fe71176909c3`

### Genesis file

**The genesis file for Interchain Security consumer chains must include the CCV (Cross Chain Validation) state generated by the provider chain _after_ the spawn time is reached.**

_The final genesis file will be provided here shortly after the `spawn_time` has passed._

The fresh-genesis file with was generated using the following settings:

* Chain ID: `flash`
* Denom: `uflsh`
* Signed blocks window: `"30000"`
* Genesis accounts were added to provide funds for a faucet and a relayer that will be run by CryptoCrew.
* Genesis file **without CCV state**: [`flash-fresh-genesis.json`](flash-fresh-genesis.json), SHA256: `b35914fcf6fae5cd978705c0230f350e1fb2b1ae39c6dde2c0d0000ca42a1834`
  * **This is provided only for verification, this is not the genesis file validators should be running their nodes with.**

## Endpoints

* **p2p seeds : ``** # TODO: add seed
* **p2p persistent peers : ``** # TODO: add peers
* These peers represent the `CryptoCrew Validators` validator. 
* Please keep in mind that any validator that does not come online after 67% of the voting power is up and running, is likely to be slashed for downtime, potentially resulting in being jailed (the `signed_blocks_window` parameter is set to `30000`).

## Join via Bash Script

On the node machine:
- Copy the `node_key.json` and `priv_validator_key.json` files for your validator.
  - **These should be the same ones as the ones from your provider node**.
- Run one of the following scripts:
  - Flash service: [flash-init.sh](flash-init.sh)
  - Cosmovisor service: [flash-init-cv.sh](flash-init-cv.sh)
- Wait until the spawn time is reached and the genesis file with the CCV states is available.
- Overwrite the genesis file with the one that includes the CCV states.
  - The default location is `$HOME/.flash/config/genesis.json`.
- Enable and start the service:
  - Flash
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable flash
    sudo systemctl start flash
    ```
  - Cosmovisor
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable cv-flash
    sudo systemctl start cv-flash
    ```
- To follow the log, use:
  - Flash: `journalctl -fu flash`
  - Cosmovisor: `journalctl -fu cv-flash`
- If the log does not show up right away, run `systemctl restart systemd-journald`.
